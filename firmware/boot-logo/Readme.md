## Updating process for the boot logo on the firmware

Once you compile the firmware, it puts default Makerbase bitmaps into the assets folder next to the firmware binary file.
There is a bmp_logo.bin inside the asset folder. Simply replace it with the bmp_logo.bin file next to this Readme file.
Then upload it to the controller.
