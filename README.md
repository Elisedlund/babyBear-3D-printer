# the babyBear 3D Printer
## A very small 3D printer! that slightly smaller than an A4 paper including a spool of filament.

Just the footprint is small. It has a 160mm diameter build plate and up to 300mm work height.
It's a complete 3D printer with quick change tool head. So the plan is making it a laser cutter and cnc milling machine along with printing.

```diff
+ All STL and BOM files have been updated.

! A laser cut toolhead will be added in a few weeks.
! A cnc milling toolhead will be added until February.
```
## Important information about the firmware
The firmware here is a cartesian setup and requires post-processing using this tool :

Marlin polar kinematics are in development and will be uploaded soon. Then it will be possible to use g-codes without post-processing.

## Great people who helped me on this project.

Most of the babyBear components donated by V-slot Poland.

Filaments and some local logistics provided by RE3D filaments.
