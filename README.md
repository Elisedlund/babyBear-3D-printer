# the babyBear 3D Printer
## A very small 3D printer! that slightly smaller than an A4 paper including a spool of filament.

Just the footprint is small. It has a 160mm diameter build plate and up to 300mm work height.
It's a complete 3D printer with quick change tool head. So the plan is making it a laser cutter and cnc milling machine along with printing.

```diff
+ All STL and BOM files have been updated.
+ Firmware is configured for the babyBear
```
