# babyBear-3D-printer
A very small, fully functional FDM printer!
Just the footprint is small. It has a 160mm diameter build plate and up to 300mm work height.
It's a complete 3D printer with quick change tool head. So the plan is making it a laser cutter and cnc milling machine along with printing.
