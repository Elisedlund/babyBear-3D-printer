## Components:
Component links are selected with care. But I didn't buy them directly.
For good quality
Most of the babyBear components donated by V-slot Poland.
the rest collected from local stores.

## Fasteners:
Online stores often sell fasteners in odd varieties and quantities.
If you have a local fastener shop, it would be easier to get them.

There are different fastener grades. Usually you can see 8.8, 10.9, 12.9 etc.
Higher the number means stronger and more brittle the fastener.
I recommend 10.9 grade for this project.
Please keep in mind; If a seller didn't specify the grade, it is most likely 8.8 or even less.


## Tools:
You will need those tools to build the babyBear.
They are also common tools for 3D printing and such projects.
