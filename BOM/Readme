ODS is a spreadsheet file format. Any office software can open it.

## Components:
Component connections are carefully selected. But I didn't buy them directly.
Most of the babyBear components donated by V-slot Poland.
The rest were collected from local stores.

I bought average quality 16010 bearings from a local store for 4USD each and F608 bearings from aliexpress for less than 1USD each.
I don't recommend cheapest bearings. They tend to be very bad. But best selling cheap bearings are usually good enough for such projects.


## Fasteners:
Online stores often sell fasteners in odd varieties and quantities.
It would be easier to get fasteners from a local shop.

There are different fastener grades. Usually you can see 8.8, 10.9, 12.9 etc.
Higher the number means stronger the fastener.
I recommend fasteners grade higher than 8.8 for this project.


## Tools:
You will need those tools to build the babyBear.
They are also common tools for 3D printing and such projects.
